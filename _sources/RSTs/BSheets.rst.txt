#########################

This workbook is made up of several worksheets which contain links to each other. The main end-point worksheets are **Summary** and **Budget**. **Summary** holds data pertinent to the Tax Accountant, and **Budget** allows analysis of personal expenses.

The worksheets supporting this preceeding sheets are **InvestProp**, **568CreditCard**, **259Checking**, **822HomeLoan** and **972Savings**. Naming convention is the last three digits of the account and the description.

Summary
*******

The **Summary** Worksheet is comprised of two main columns; Expenses and Income. The expenses are only those relevant to a tax accountant, such as home loan payments and professional fees and donations, while income is comprised of all income.

The fields on this page are linked to specific fields on relevant account pages and update dynamically.


*******************
Investment Property
*******************

The **InvestProp** Worksheet contains mainly manually-entered investment property financial data, such as Loan Payments, Body Corprorate fees, Property Management fees, Council Rates fees and Water.

Much of this is duplicated on the **259Checking** Worksheet, such as renter payments and loan repayments, and the workbook manages that particular data via that worksheet. However, Property Management information is only available via PDF and thus manually-entered in.


***********
Credit Card
***********

The **568CredCard** Worksheet is a date-sorted, formatted Credit Card transaction worksheet. The data is imported from a downloaded CSV file into the Import Worksheet, then sorted and formatted. It is from this Import worksheet data is copied to the **568CredCard** Worksheet.

The columns are as follows::

    A - Date
    B - Transaction Amount
    C - Transaction Target (Payee or Payor)
    D - Transaction Code

After the transactions have been copied, the Code Assignment software is invoked:

which then compares transaction target entries to those in ClassCC, leaving the Code column [D] blank if it doesn't find that tranaction. 90% or more transactions are going to be with the same vendors, so it's a simple matter of updating ClassCC after running this software, which is usually only a matter of a few minutes.
