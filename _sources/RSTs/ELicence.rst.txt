How to Contact the Developer
****************************

Whilst software developers endeavour to write clean, robust software with consistent, predictable behaviour, bugs do happen. The TaxWorkbook developer is committed to supporting this workbook, hence this document and a web presence on github.

A number of means exist to contact the developer:

   * gmail: robinseahahn@gmail.com
   * `github issues page <https://github.com/robinboncoeur/TaxWorkbook/issues>`_
   
To find the most current documentation - a (probably) updated version of this document - go to:
   
   * `my Github CallSheet page <https://robinboncoeur.github.io/TaxWorkbook/>`_
