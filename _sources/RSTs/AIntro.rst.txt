The Tax Workbook Guide
**********************

This Excel-based utility is designed to manage creating and maintaining Banking Transactions Data for Tax Purposes in spreadsheet form. The workbook contains both data inported from CSV files as well as (much less frequently) data manually entered from PDFs, such as rental property repair details.

It replaces a manually-managed ledger approach to tax-data figures. The tax accountant requested an income and expenditures summary worksheet in Excel. Using the power of Excel and VBA, downloaded CSV files populate the Accounts Worksheets, which inform fields on the Summary Sheet through links: this happens  dynamically. 

This Tax Workbook is a living document. At the end of the fiscal year, it is submitted to the tax accountant.


===================
Worksheets Overview
===================

This workbook contains transaction data from primarily ANZ bank accounts. On most of the worksheets, the data is categorised through codes:

A simple =SUMIF() tallies up Transaction Categories based on those codes in column D:

Using the Credit Card worksheet as an example, the codes in column D are assigned via Excel 2016 Visual-Basic for Applications functions (VBA), copied from the **ClassCC Worksheet** which has an instance of the Transaction Target and the associated code:

.. image:: ../images/tw01Codes03.png

The software that copies the Transaction Code from the ClassCC sheet to the 568CredCard sheet is run from **Tax Workbook** menu option under the main menu option Tax Workbook:

Much of the workbook's data is managed in this fashion.


=============
Functionality
=============

When "Tax Workbook" is first opened in Excel, security settings commonly set by organisations may issue a security warning:
   
   * *Some active content has been disabled. Click for more details.*
   
Next to this warning is a button labelled **[Enable Content]**. While the spreadsheet's data can be viewed without "enabling content", the menu and other features in this workbook will only run if the content is enabled. The only needs to be done once.

How to Best Use Help
********************

This Help file pertains to TaxWkbk 2021, version 0.6 (v0.6).

While Tax Workbook's use seems pretty straight-forward to the developer, he realises that his approach to running software could differ wildly to other inhabitants of the solar system run software: hence, this Help file.

Why this approach to a Help file? See the footnote [#fhlp01]_.

=============
From The Menu
=============

When this workbook loads, it includes a special Menu option -- next to "Help" -- called "Tax Workbook":

Help, much like the rest of the document is a work-in-progress, so all topics may not be covered.

The same goes for the VBA code: it works 99% of the time, but every now and then, the VBA gremlins interfere.

  .. rubric:: Notes

  .. [#fhlp01] As Microsoft in their wisdom didn't see fit to include a means to provide a very flexible custom help documentation system without installing questionable add-ons - something most security-conscious IT departments of organisations would definitely never permit - a method of sharing help information had to be come up with that would provide that information quickly, consistently and accurately. Therefore, I have chosen HTML (think: Web) pages for documenting Help. The degree of success in finding help in these pages depends on how the user generally searches for help on a computer, but I would suggest this approach.
