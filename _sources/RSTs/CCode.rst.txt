 .. rubric:: Notes
   
 .. [#phone01] The individual may elect to have the landline phone as primary phone, or the mobile. Be sure to ask. Also, this may change: as you can see the [Swap] ("Swap") button makes assigning opposite roles to the phone numbers a trivial task. 
 
 .. [#activ02] It is suggested to leave the staff member's record in the "NameAndPhone" sheet as employment status can revert to what it was before he or she left. These things happen, so it's nice to already have that data there.
